  Face Detection is done by faceapi.js and route calulation is done by Trimble MAPS API.
  face/ is the Django app that detect face expression in face-script.js and send the detected info to <script> in maps.html 
through localStorage. (API access might expire and you won't be able to see the map functions!)
